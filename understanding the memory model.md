# Understanding the memory model

## Memory

Memory is just starage, it can be `ROM` or `RAM`.

Storing and retrieving data in `RAM` is faster than that of `ROM`. `ROM` is persistent while `RAM` is volatile.

## Byte

1Mb = 1024 _ 1024 _ 1024 Kb = 1048576Kb

## Addresses

Processors read 8 bits at a time from the memory.
